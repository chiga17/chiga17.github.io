      <description>Candidate of Sciences in Applied Mathematics 2024&#xA;Degree Awarded: By decision of the dissertation council, the academic degree of Candidate of Sciences in Applied Mathematics was awarded (Protocol No. 29 dated 30.09.2024)&#xA;Dissertation Topic: On chaotic attractors and repellers in systems with a compact phase space&#xA;Summary: The dissertation is dedicated to the study of chaotic dynamics in systems described by diffeomorphisms on compact manifolds. New methods for analyzing chaotic dynamics have been developed, including determining the applicability limits of linear response theory and verifying the non-uniform hyperbolicity of a system. A novel scenario of attractor–repeller collision for three-dimensional torus maps has been demonstrated, along with methods for constructing heterodimensional cycles. A software package for studying reversible and dissipative systems has been created. The results have been presented at international conferences and seminars and published in leading journals on dynamical chaos theory.</description>
